# Linux Cluster Monitoring Ag
This project is under development. Since this project follows the GitFlow, the final work will be merged to the main branch after Team Code Team.


Note: You are NOT allowed to copy any content from the scrum board, including text, diagrams, code, etc. Your Github will be visible and shared with Jarvis clients, so you have to create unique content that impresses your future bossðŸ˜Ž.

# Introduction
(about 150-200 words)
Discuss the design of the project. What does this project/product do? Who are the users? What are the technologies you have used? (e.g. bash, docker, git, etc..)

A RDBMS data with collected data about each node/servers in the networks hardware specifications as well as resource usages (CPU/Memory) for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) which manages a linux cluster of 10 nodes/servers running CentOS7 
ans they want to use this data for reports and planning purposes.

The technologies  used to complete this project include include bash, git, docker,linux
# Quick Start
Use markdown code block for your quick-start commands
- Start a psql instance using psql_docker.sh
- Create tables using ddl.sql
- Insert hardware specs data into the DB using host_info.sh
- Insert hardware usage data into the DB using host_usage.sh
- Crontab setup

# Implemenation
Discuss how you implement the project.
## Architecture
Draw a cluster diagram with three Linux hosts, a DB, and agents (use draw.io website). Image must be saved to the `assets` directory.

## Scripts
Shell script description and usage (use markdown code block for script usage)
- psql_docker.sh
- host_info.sh
- host_usage.sh
- crontab
- queries.sql (describe what business problem you are trying to resolve)

## Database Modeling
Describe the schema of each table using markdown table syntax (do not put any sql code)
- `host_info`
- `host_usage`

# Test
How did you test your bash scripts and SQL queries? What was the result?

# Deployment
How did you deploy your app? (e.g. Github, crontab, docker)

# Improvements
Write at least three things you want to improve 
e.g. 
- handle hardware update 
- blah
- blah
