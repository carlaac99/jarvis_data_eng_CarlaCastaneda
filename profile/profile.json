Used MongoDB database to store user names and the amount of time the puzzles take to be solved. Can solve puzzles randomly generated or take user input. Allows for user to solve puzzles of varying difficulties and highlights sudoku box red if the user input violates the sudoku puzzle constraints and will not allow for any other inputs except numbers to be entered. Used Javascript, Node.js, React, Flask, Python, HTML/CSS, MongoDB",

        "Created a Monitoring Agent program using Bash scripts which collect hardware specs and memory usage data from nodes in Linux cluster. I did this by creating a PSQL instance with docker and creating a database called host_agent using PSQL REPL and creating tables host_info and host_usage to store the hardware specs and server usage. I then created shell scripts host_info.sh and host_usage.sh to collect the information with bash commands stored in variables and then inserted them into the respective database tables . host_usage.sh inserts a new entry to the host_usage table every minute that the server is running and is healthy. We do this by using crontab to schedule the script to execute every minute.",

I love helping others and learning about the problems that are affecting my community. I feel most fulfilled when I can help solve a problem using my creativity while also challenging myself and learning new skills. At my current role at Jarvis Consulting I have been able to strengthen my problem solving skills and my knowledge of object oriented programming and APIs, and as well, be able to pick up on so many new technical skills such as bash scripting and Agile development.I am most excited about how artificial Intelligence will progress and help better the lives of people  by providing solutions for many global and local issues."
